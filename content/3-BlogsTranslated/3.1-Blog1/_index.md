# A Unified JSON Data Search System on AWS

## Introduction

Modern applications such as streaming platforms, e-commerce systems, and large data products rarely store all data in a single database. Some data requires low-latency access, some requires strong transactional consistency, and other data is stored for analytics or long-term reporting.

This raises an important question: how can users search across many data sources quickly and accurately?

AWS solves this pattern by combining purpose-built data services with Amazon OpenSearch Service to create a unified search layer.

## Why not use only one database?

When I first started building web applications, I thought a single database such as MySQL could store everything: users, products, orders, activity history, and logs. After studying AWS and large-scale system architectures, I realized that this approach works only for small projects.

As data grows to millions or billions of records, one database becomes a limitation for performance, scalability, and operational cost. Each data type should use the tool that fits it best:

* DynamoDB is suitable for fast key-value and real-time access.
* Aurora PostgreSQL is suitable for transactional data.
* DocumentDB is suitable for flexible JSON documents.
* S3 is suitable for large-scale storage and data lakes.
* Redshift is suitable for analytics and reporting.

## Overall architecture

The system has two main layers.

The **data storage layer** includes Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon DocumentDB, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. Each service stores the type of data it handles best.

The **search layer** uses Amazon OpenSearch Service. Searchable data is synchronized into OpenSearch so users can query one unified search endpoint instead of searching each source database separately.

## AWS service roles

### Amazon DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a low-latency NoSQL database with high scalability. It fits user profiles, activity history, and real-time application state. For example, a streaming platform can store a user's current movie and resume timestamp so playback can continue quickly on another device.

### Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

Aurora PostgreSQL is used for payments, orders, and other transactional information. Because it supports ACID transactions, Aurora helps keep business data consistent and reliable.

### Amazon DocumentDB

DocumentDB stores flexible JSON data such as product information, metadata, and content with changing attributes. This is useful in e-commerce, where one product may have completely different attributes from another.

### Amazon S3

Amazon S3 acts as a data lake, log archive, and backup store. It provides low-cost storage with virtually unlimited scalability and is often the foundation for analytics pipelines.

### Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift handles large-scale analytical workloads. With the SUPER data type and PartiQL, Redshift can query complex JSON structures efficiently. In a streaming platform, Redshift can analyze billions of play, pause, and skip events from S3, calculate trend scores, and export aggregated results back to the search layer.

### Amazon OpenSearch Service

OpenSearch is the central search component. It supports full-text search, fuzzy search, auto suggestion, vector search, and AI search. For example, when a user searches for a product with incomplete or imperfect keywords, OpenSearch can still return relevant results.

## Synchronizing data into OpenSearch

OpenSearch Ingestion (OSI) collects, transforms, and synchronizes data into Amazon OpenSearch Service. The synchronization process usually has two stages:

* **Initial Load:** load the baseline data from DynamoDB, Aurora, DocumentDB, or S3.
* **Change Data Capture:** after the baseline is created, synchronize only new changes.

This design reduces load on source systems, lowers cost, and keeps search data close to real time.

## Conclusion

Combining DynamoDB, Aurora, DocumentDB, S3, Redshift, and OpenSearch creates a modern data architecture that is flexible and scalable. Amazon OpenSearch Service acts as the unified search layer that connects data from multiple systems and gives users a powerful search experience.
